# Deep Dive: Secure Session Authentication

The primary goal of the Inventory Management System was to implement a **stateful, "security-first" authentication flow** that protects sensitive merchant data from common web vulnerabilities.

## The Strategy: Sessions over Tokens
While many modern applications use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) stored in `localStorage`, I chose **Session-based authentication** with server-side persistence in PostgreSQL. 

### Why not LocalStorage?
Storing sensitive credentials in `localStorage` makes an application vulnerable to **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**. By using **HttpOnly Cookies**, we ensure that the session identifier is inaccessible to client-side JavaScript, effectively neutralizing XSS-based credential theft.

## The Authentication Lifecycle

### 1. The Handshake (Login)
When a user submits their credentials, a "silent" security exchange occurs:
* **Hashing:** The backend verifies the password using `bcrypt`.
* **Session Storage:** A unique session record is created in a PostgreSQL table via `connect-pg-simple`.
* **The Cookie:** The server sends a `Set-Cookie` header with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Lax` flags.

### 2. Validating Requests
Every subsequent request (like `/items`) follows this logic:
1. The browser automatically attaches the session cookie.
2. The server intercepts the request and checks the cookie against the PostgreSQL session store.
3. If valid, the server attaches the `user_id` to the request object.

## Data Scoping & Multi-Tenancy
To ensure a "Merchant-First" experience where users never see each other's data, I implemented **Strict Data Scoping**. Every database query is filtered by the authenticated `user_id`:

```sql
-- The backend automatically injects the session's user_id ($1)
SELECT * FROM items 
WHERE id = $2 AND user_id = $1;
```

## Summary of Security Wins
- No XSS exposure: Sensitive identifiers are hidden from JavaScript.
- No stale data: Sessions can be revoked instantly from the database.
- Server-side Truth: The client never dictates "who" they are; the server maintains that state.
